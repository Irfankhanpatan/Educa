         <p>
            For a long time, the only reliable cross browser-compatible tools available for creating CSS layouts were
            things like
            floats and positioning. These are fine, and they work, but in some ways they are also rather limiting and
            frustrating.
         </p>
         <p>
            The following simple layout requirements are either difficult or impossible to achieve with such tools,
            in any kind of
            convenient, flexible way:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.</li>
            <li>Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height,
               regardless of how much
               width/height is available.</li>
            <li>Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different
               amount of content.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>As you'll see in subsequent sections, flexbox makes a lot of layout tasks much easier. Let's dig in!</p>
         <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> HTML basics (study <a
                  href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML">Introduction to HTML</a>), and an idea of how
               CSS works (study <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS">Introduction to CSS</a>.)</p>

         <header><h2>Flexible sizing of flex items</h2></header>
         <p>Let's now return to our first example, and look at how we can control what proportion of space flex items
            take up
            compared to the other flex items. Fire up your local copy of <a class="external"
               href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/css/css-layout/flexbox/flexbox0.html"
               rel="noopener">flexbox0.html</a>, or take a copy of <a class="external"
               href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/css/css-layout/flexbox/flexbox1.html"
               rel="noopener">flexbox1.html</a> as a new starting point (<a class="external"
               href="http://mdn.github.io/learning-area/css/css-layout/flexbox/flexbox1.html" rel="noopener">see it
               live</a>).
         </p>
         <p>First, add the following rule to the bottom of your CSS:</p>
         <div class="code-snip">
            <span class="selector">article</span><span class="token"> {</span>
            <span class="property">flex</span><span class="token">: </span>1<span class="token">;</span>
            <span class="token">}</span>
         </div>
         <p>This is a unitless proportion value that dictates how much of the available space along the main axis
            each flex item
            will take up compared to other flex items. In this case, we are giving each <a
               href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article"
               title="The HTML <article> element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication)."><code>&lt;article&gt;</code></a>
            element the same value (a value of 1), which means they will all take up an equal amount of the spare
            space left
            after things like padding and margin have been set. It is relative to other flex items, meaning that
            giving each flex
            item a value of 400000 would have exactly the same effect.</p>
         <p>Now add the following rule below the previous one:</p>
         <div class="code-snip">
            <span class="selector">article:nth-of-type(3)</span><span class="token"> {</span>
            <span class="property">flex</span><span class="token">: </span>2<span class="token">;</span>
            <span class="token">}</span>
        </div>
         <p>Now when you refresh, you'll see that the third <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article"
               title="The HTML <article> element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication)."><code>&lt;article&gt;</code></a>
            takes up twice as much of the available width as the other two. There are now four proportion units
            available in
            total (since 1 + 1 + 2 = 4). The first two flex items have one unit each, so they take 1/4 of the
            available space
            each. The third one has two units, so it takes up 2/4 of the available space (or one-half).</p>
         <p>You can also specify a minimum size value inside the flex value. Try updating your existing article rules
            like so:</p>
         <div class="code-snip">
         <span class="selector">article</span><span class="token"> {</span>
         <span class="property">flex</span><span class="token">: </span>1 200px<span class="token">;</span>
         <span class="token">}</span>

         <span class="selector">article:nth-of-type(3)</span><span class="token"> {</span>
         <span class="property">flex</span><span class="token">: </span>2 200px<span class="token">;</span>
         <span class="token">}</span>
      </div>
         <p>This basically states "Each flex item will first be given 200px of the available space. After that, the
            rest of the
            available space will be shared out according to the proportion units." Try refreshing and you'll see a
            difference in how
            the space is shared.</p>
         <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13406/flexbox-example1.png" alt="">
         <p>The real value of flexbox can be seen in its flexibility/responsiveness — if you resize the browser
            window, or add
            another <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article"
               title="The HTML <article> element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication)."><code>&lt;article&gt;</code></a>
            element, the layout continues to work just fine.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="flex:_shorthand_versus_longhand">
         <header><h2>flex: shorthand versus longhand</h2></header>
         <p><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex"
               title="The flex CSS shorthand property sets how a flex item will grow or shrink to fit the space available in its flex container."><code>flex</code></a>
            is a shorthand property that can specify up to three different values:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>The unitless proportion value we discussed above. This can be specified individually using the <a
                  href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-grow"
                  title="The flex-grow CSS&nbsp;property sets the flex grow factor of a flex item main size."><code>flex-grow</code></a>
               longhand property.</li>
            <li>A second unitless proportion value — <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-shrink"
                  title="The flex-shrink CSS property sets the flex shrink factor of a flex item. If the size of all flex items is larger than the flex container, items shrink to fit according to flex-shrink."><code>flex-shrink</code></a>
               — that comes into play when the flex items are overflowing their container. This specifies how much of
               the
               overflowing amount is taken away from each flex item's size, to stop them overflowing their container.
               This is
               quite an advanced flexbox feature, and we won't be covering it any further in this article.</li>
            <li>The minimum size value we discussed above. This can be specified individually using the <a
                  href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-basis"
                  title="The flex-basis CSS property sets the initial main size of a flex item. It sets the size of the content box unless otherwise set with box-sizing."><code>flex-basis</code></a>
               longhand value.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>We'd advise against using the longhand flex properties unless you really have to (for example, to
            override something
            previously set). They lead to a lot of extra code being written, and they can be somewhat confusing.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Horizontal_and_vertical_alignment">
         <header><h2>Horizontal and vertical alignment</h2></header>
         <p>You can also use flexbox features to align flex items along the main or cross axis. Let's explore this by
            looking at
            a new example — <a class="external"
               href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/css/css-layout/flexbox/flex-align0.html"
               rel="noopener">flex-align0.html</a> (<a class="external"
               href="http://mdn.github.io/learning-area/css/css-layout/flexbox/flex-align0.html" rel="noopener">see
               it live
               also</a>) — which we are going to turn into a neat, flexible button/toolbar. At the moment you'll see
            a horizontal
            menu bar, with some buttons jammed into the top left-hand corner.</p>
         <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13414/flexbox-example5.png" alt="">
         <p>First, take a local copy of this example.</p>
         <p>Now, add the following to the bottom of the example's CSS:</p>
         <div class="code-snip">
         <span class="selector">div</span><span class="token"> {</span>
         <span class="property">display</span><span class="token">: </span>flex<span class="token">;</span>
         <span class="property">align-items</span><span class="token">: </span>center<span class="token">;</span>
         <span class="property">justify-content</span><span class="token">: </span>space-around<span class="token">;</span>
         <span class="token">}</span>
      </div>
         <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/17210/flexbox_center_space-around.png" alt="">
         <p>Refresh the page and you'll see that the buttons are now nicely centered, horizontally and vertically.
            We've done this
            via two new properties.</p>
         <p><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-items"
               title="The CSS align-items property sets the align-self value on all direct children as a group."><code>align-items</code></a>
            controls where the flex items sit on the cross axis.</p>
         <ul>
            <li>By default, the value is <code>stretch</code>, which stretches all flex items to fill the parent in
               the direction
               of the cross axis. If the parent doesn't have a fixed width in the cross axis direction, then all flex
               items will
               become as long as the longest flex item. This is how our first example got equal height columns by
               default.</li>
            <li>The <code>center</code> value that we used in our above code causes the items to maintain their
               intrinsic
               dimensions, but be centered along the cross axis. This is why our current example's buttons are
               centered
               vertically.</li>
            <li>You can also have values like <code>flex-start</code> and <code>flex-end</code>, which will align all
               items at
               the start and end of the cross axis respectively. See <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-items"
                  title="The CSS align-items property sets the align-self value on all direct children as a group."><code>align-items</code></a>
               for the full details.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>You can override the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-items"
               title="The CSS align-items property sets the align-self value on all direct children as a group."><code>align-items</code></a>
            behavior for individual flex items by applying the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-self"
               title="The align-self CSS property overrides a grid or flex item's align-items value. In Grid, it aligns the item inside the&nbsp;grid area. In Flexbox, it aligns the item on the cross axis."><code>align-self</code></a>
            property to them. For example, try adding the following to your CSS:</p>
         <div class="code-snip">
         <span class="selector">button:first-child</span><span class="token"> {</span>
         <span class="property">align-self</span><span class="token">: </span>flex-end<span class="token">;</span>
         <span class="token">}</span>
      </div>
         <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/17211/flexbox_first-child_flex-end.png" alt="">
         <p>Have a look at what effect this has, and remove it again when you've finished.</p>
         <p><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content"
               title="The CSS justify-content property defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main-axis of a flex container, and the inline axis of a grid container."><code>justify-content</code></a>
            controls where the flex items sit on the main axis.</p>
         <ul>
            <li>The default value is <code>flex-start</code>, which makes all the items sit at the start of the main
               axis.</li>
            <li>You can use <code>flex-end</code> to make them sit at the end.</li>
            <li><code>center</code> is also a value for <code>justify-content</code>, and will make the flex items
               sit in the
               center of the main axis.</li>
            <li>The value we've used above, <code>space-around</code>, is useful — it distributes all the items
               evenly along the
               main axis, with a bit of space left at either end.</li>
            <li>There is another value, <code>space-between</code>, which is very similar to
               <code>space-around</code> except
               that it doesn't leave any space at either end.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>We'd like to encourage you to play with these values to see how they work before you continue.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Ordering_flex_items">
         <header><h2>Ordering flex items</h2></header>
         <p>Flexbox also has a feature for changing the layout order of flex items, without affecting the source
            order. This is
            another thing that is impossible to do with traditional layout methods.</p>
         <p>The code for this is simple; try adding the following CSS to your button bar example code:</p>
         <div class="code-snip">
            <span class="selector">button:first-child</span><span class="token"> {</span>
            <span class="property">order</span><span class="token">: </span>1<span class="token">;</span>
            <span class="token">}</span>
         </div>
         <p>Refresh, and you'll now see that the "Smile" button has moved to the end of the main axis. Let's talk
            about how this
            works in a bit more detail:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>By default, all flex items have an <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/order"
                  title="The order CSS property sets the order to lay out an item in a flex or grid container. Items in a container are sorted by ascending order value and then by their source code order."><code>order</code></a>
               value of 0.</li>
            <li>Flex items with higher order values set on them will appear later in the display order than items
               with lower
               order values.</li>
            <li>Flex items with the same order value will appear in their source order. So if you have four items
               with order
               values of 2, 1, 1, and 0 set on them respectively, their display order would be 4th, 2nd, 3rd, then
               1st.</li>
            <li>The 3rd item appears after the 2nd because it has the same order value and is after it in the source
               order.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>You can set negative order values to make items appear earlier than items with 0 set. For example, you
            could make the
            "Blush" button appear at the start of the main axis using the following rule:</p>
         <div class="code-snip">
            <span class="selector">button:first-child</span><span class="token"> {</span>
            <span class="property">order</span><span class="token">: </span>-1<span class="token">;</span>
            <span class="token">}</span>
         </div>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Nested_flex_boxes">
         <header><h2>Nested flex boxes</h2></header>
         <p>It is possible to create some pretty complex layouts with flexbox. It is perfectly ok to set a flex item
            to also be a
            flex container, so that its children are also laid out like flexible boxes. Have a look at <a

         <p>The HTML for this is fairly simple. We've got a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section"

         <img src="https://i.ibb.co/0cd4mNQ/layout.png" alt="">
         <p>Let's look at the code we've used for the layout.</p>
         <p>First of all, we set the children of the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section"
               title="The HTML <section> element represents a standalone section — which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it — contained within an HTML document."><code>&lt;section&gt;</code></a>
            to be laid out as flexible boxes.</p>
         <div class="code-snip">
            <span class="selector">section</span><span class="token"> {</span>
            <span class="property">display</span><span class="token">: </span>flex<span class="token">;</span>
            <span class="token">}</span>
         </div>
         <p>Next, we set some flex values on the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article"
               title="The HTML <article> element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication)."><code>&lt;article&gt;</code></a>s
            themselves. Take special note of the 2nd rule here — we are setting the third <a
               href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article"
               title="The HTML <article> element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication)."><code>&lt;article&gt;</code></a>
            to have its children laid out like flex items too, but this time we are laying them out like a column.
         </p>
         <div class="code-snip">
            <span class="selector">article</span><span class="token"> {</span>
            <span class="property">flex</span><span class="token">: </span>1 200px<span class="token">;</span>
            <span class="token">}</span>

            <span class="selector">article:nth-of-type(3)</span><span class="token"> {</span>
            <span class="property">flex</span><span class="token">: </span>3 200px<span class="token">;</span>
            <span class="property">display</span><span class="token">: </span>flex<span class="token">;</span>
            <span class="property">flex-flow</span><span class="token">: </span>column<span class="token">;</span>
            <span class="token">}</span>
         </div>
         <p>Next, we select the first <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div"
               title="The HTML Content Division element (<div>) is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled using CSS."><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></a>.
            We first use <code>flex:1 100px;</code> to effectively give it a minimum height of 100px, then we set its
            children
            (the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button"
               title="The HTML <button> element represents a clickable button, used to submit forms or anywhere in a document for accessible, standard button functionality."><code>&lt;button&gt;</code></a>
            elements) to also be laid out like flex items. Here we lay them out in a wrapping row, and align them in
            the center
            of the available space, as we did in the individual button example we saw earlier.</p>
         <div class="code-snip">
               <span class="selector">article:nth-of-type(3) div:first-child</span><span class="token"> {</span>
               <span class="property">flex</span><span class="token">: </span>1 100px<span class="token">;</span>
               <span class="property">display</span><span class="token">: </span>flex<span class="token">;</span>
               <span class="property">flex-flow</span><span class="token">: </span>row wrap<span class="token">;</span>
               <span class="property">align-items</span><span class="token">: </span>center<span class="token">;</span>
               <span class="property">justify-content</span><span class="token">: </span>space-around<span class="token">;</span>
               <span class="token">}</span>
            </div>
         <p>Finally, we set some sizing on the button, but more interestingly we give it a flex value of 1 auto. This
            has a very
            interesting effect, which you'll see if you try resizing your browser window width. The buttons will take
            up as much
            space as they can, and sit as many on the same line as they can, but when they can no longer fit
            comfortably on the same
            line, they'll drop down to create new lines.</p>
         <div class="code-snip">
               <span class="selector">button</span><span class="token"> {</span>
               <span class="property">flex</span><span class="token">: </span>1 auto<span class="token">;</span>
               <span class="property">margin</span><span class="token">: </span>5px<span class="token">;</span>
               <span class="property">font-size</span><span class="token">: </span>18px<span class="token">;</span>
               <span class="property">line-height</span><span class="token">: </span>1.5<span class="token">;</span>
               <span class="token">}</span>
            </div>

         <p>Flexbox support is available in most new browsers — Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Microsoft Edge, and IE 11,
            newer versions of
            Android/iOS, etc. However, you should be aware that there are still older browsers in use that don't
            support Flexbox (or
            do, but support a really old, out-of-date version of it.)</p>
         <p>While you are just learning and experimenting, this doesn't matter too much; however, if you are
            considering using
            flexbox in a real website you need to do testing and make sure that your user experience is still
            acceptable in as many
            browsers as possible.</p>
         <p>Flexbox is a bit trickier than some CSS features. For example, if a browser is missing a CSS drop shadow,
            then the site
            will likely still be usable. Not supporting flexbox features however will probably break a layout
            completely, making it
            unusable.</p>

            with it as you
            travel forward with your learning. Next, we'll have a look at another important aspect of CSS layouts —
